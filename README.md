# Flatplay

Flatplay is a simple CLI tool to build and run Flatpak applications. It's designed to be easy to integrate into your workflows with editors like Zed or neovim.

Note that this is a **work in progress** and you might encounter issues along the way.

## External Dependencies

Flatplay relies on the following external commands to be available on your system:

- `git`
- `gdbus`
- `flatpak`
- `flatpak-builder`

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install into ~/.local/bin (or XDG_BIN_HOME)
just install

# Enable completions (optional, replace with your shell)
flatplay completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/flatplay.fish

flatplay --help

# cd into a project directory
# then simply run:
flatplay

# This will attempt to build and run the project.
```

## Integrate into editors

### Zed

To integrate flatplay in Zed you can define custom tasks and key bindings.

Add the following tasks to your `tasks.json` file (you can open it with the `zed: open tasks` action):

```json
{
  "label": "build & run flatpak",
  "command": "flatplay build-and-run"
},
{
  "label": "build flatpak",
  "command": "flatplay build"
},
{
  "label": "run flatpak",
  "command": "flatplay run"
},
{
  "label": "stop flatpak",
  "command": "flatplay stop"
},
{
  "label": "clean flatpak build",
  "command": "flatplay clean"
},
{
  "label": "update flatpak dependencies",
  "command": "flatplay update-dependencies"
},
{
  "label": "select flatpak manifest",
  "command": "flatplay select-manifest"
}
```

Next, add new bindings to your `keymaps.json` file (you can open it with the `zed: open keymap` action):

```json
{
  "context": "Workspace",
  "bindings": {
    "ctrl-alt-b": ["task::Spawn", { "task_name": "build & run flatpak" }],
    "ctrl-alt-r": ["task::Spawn", { "task_name": "run flatpak" }],
    "ctrl-alt-c": ["task::Spawn", { "task_name": "stop flatpak" }]
  }
},
```

Then you can run any of the tasks by pressing `Alt-Shift-T`, or use `Ctrl-Alt-B`, `Ctrl-Alt-R` or `Ctrl-Alt-C` to build & run, run or stop flatpaks.

# Some notes

- A lot of the logic is borrowed from [`flatpak-vscode`](https://github.com/bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-vscode).
- There will be bugs and missing features. Please report them, or better yet, send a PR.
- I'm not a Rust programmer.
- I hope to improve it over time and I hope Bilal forgives me for the sins I've committed here.
